The goal of this exercise is to refactor the code and fix existing bugs. Please refactor the code applying best practices.

Hints:
- _Pizzeria_ will have another location in the future (Gold Coast)
- The menu in every pizzeria is a subject of change
- You cannot order pizzas that are not available in the selected location
- We still improve our baking process, so it will change in the future. The baking process will vary depending on pizza type
- The same pizza is prepared in the same way across all the locations. The only difference is the price
- We love built-in quality in our products

Nice-to-have:
- We would like to add pizza toppings to the menu: extra cheese, mayo, olive oil
- Our customers would like to order more than 1 pizza at a time


We appoint you a manager of this project, so feel free to add more features if you like :)
